Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

Original review: The purple one bled even after I put it in oxy for several hours. What you see here is the laundry bag I had it in. I spilt water in the laundry bin and this is the result. Iâ€™m just glad the only things it bled onto were those sleeves.<br />Also, these are made for someone with a big head.assistant
Rewritten review: After washing the purple one, I noticed that it had a big head, which is why it bled. I also noticed that the black one had a small head, which is why it didn't bleed. I'm glad that the only thing it bled onto were the sleeves.

Original review: 5 different bottles had loose lids which caused the polish to pour out all throughout the box. I was so excited to get these colors and now that's just ruined with a sticky mess I honestly just don't even want to deal with having to clean up. I'd honestly like a replacement but it's not even worth the hassle of having to go out to do a return and ship it back ðŸ˜”.assistant
Rewritten review: I'm so disappointed with the quality of these bottles. The loose lids have caused the polish to spill out all over the box, making it a mess and a hassle to clean up. I'm not even willing to deal with having to clean up the mess and I don't even want to return the product. I would rather have a replacement that's not going to cause any more mess.
